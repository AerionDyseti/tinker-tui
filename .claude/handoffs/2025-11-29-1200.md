# Session Handoff - tinker-tui

**Date:** 2025-11-29 12:00
**Directory:** /home/aerion/dev/tinker-tui
**Branch:** master

## Summary
Verified and committed the large domain model refactoring from previous session. All 73 tests passing, typecheck clean. Pushed to origin. The codebase now has proper separation between domain entities (Project, Session, SessionEntry) and infrastructure.

## Key Decisions
- Committed refactoring as single cohesive commit (885fbbf) with comprehensive message
- Used conventional commit format: `refactor: restructure domain model with Project entity and SessionEntry types`

## Completed
- Verified tests (73 pass) and typecheck (clean)
- Committed all domain model refactoring work (22 files, +861/-557 lines)
- Pushed to origin/master

## In Progress
- None

## Blocked On
- None

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing EntityReference system (roadmap in .serena/memories/roadmap_entity_reference_system.md)
- Continue TUI development with new domain model foundation
