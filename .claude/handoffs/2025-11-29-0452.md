# Handoff - tinker-tui
**Date:** 2025-11-29 04:52 | **Branch:** master

## Summary
Design session for input handling architecture. Established clear separation between client commands (`/`) and prompt shortcuts (`>`), with `@` reserved for future multi-agent addressing. Commands live in UI layer, shortcuts in infrastructure. No code changes - pure design work.

## Completed
- Designed command/shortcut architecture with distinct syntax and layer placement
- Identified that commands are UI-only (happen *to* conversations, not *in* them)
- Reserved `@` prefix for future agent addressing

## In Progress
- None (design phase complete, implementation not started)

## Blocked
- None

## Next
1. Create `src/tui/commands/types.ts` - ClientCommand, CommandContext, CommandResult types
2. Create `src/tui/commands/registry.ts` - registry with existing commands
3. Update `chat.tsx` to use registry instead of if-chain
4. Add `/help` command
5. Later: `src/infrastructure/shortcuts/` for `>prompt` expansion

## Key Design Points
- `/command` → UI layer, controls app, not a SessionEntry
- `>shortcut` → Infrastructure, expands to text, becomes UserInput
- `@agent` → Future multi-agent addressing
- Domain stays unaware of input mechanisms
